NGinx Configuration Repository
=

This is a general repository for all of my nginx notes and configuration files.

This configuration was built using passenger (built on rvm 1.9.3)

This server therefore has to be run while rvm is switched to 1.8.7 to access the proper gemset for the lucidappeal dev project.
